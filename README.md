# ParallaxLandscapePatcher

Automatically create complex parallax compatible texture set .esp entries and patched statics in synthesis patch. Make sure to have your landscape textures with alpha transparency in regular textures/landscape folder, and those with height map in alpha channel in textures/landscape/parallax folder. Also it's mandatory to add this line in your Skyrim.ini:
[Landscape]
sDefaultLandDiffuseTexture=parallax\dirt02.dds
